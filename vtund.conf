#   default - default session options.
#   session - Session options.     
# 
# Options _must_ be grouped by curly braces '{' '}'.

#       Used only by the server.
#
# -----------

#       This option is ignored by the client.
#
# -----------

#       'server' - Delay UDP set-up on the server side.
#	    'no' - Disable the NAT hack on both sides (default).

#	      termination. 
#	'no' - Exit after connection termination (default).
#       Used only by the client.
#
# -----------
#    keepalive - Enable 'yes' or disable 'no' connection
#	keep-alive. Ignored by the client.
#
#	May be in the form 'interval:count', where 'interval' is the
